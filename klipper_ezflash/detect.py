    MCU constant format exactly (see boards/readme.md), so this is a
    direct string comparison, not a fuzzy one.

    Connecting to a CAN device assigns it a runtime node ID via the CAN
    admin protocol's SET_NODEID command, which is why it stops responding
    to canbus_query.py-style scans afterward — there is no "release"
    command in that protocol (confirmed against Klipper's own
    CANBUS_protocol.md). To avoid leaving the device in that claimed
    state, this sends Klipper's own "reset" MCU command (falling back to
    "config_reset") right after reading the constants, over the same
    connection — EXCEPT for a device reporting CANBUS_BRIDGE, which is
    skipped entirely: klippy's own mcu.py deliberately refuses to restart
    bridge MCUs through the normal path (`_firmware_restart` returns
    immediately if `self._is_mcu_bridge and not force`), because a bridge
    MCU *is* the can0 interface itself — resetting it doesn't just drop
    one node, it disables the whole USB-CAN adapter (per Klipper's own
    CANBUS docs: "Whenever the bridge mcu is reset, Linux will disable
    the corresponding can0 interface"), which would disrupt every other
    device sharing that bus, not just the one being probed.

    This bypasses mcu.py's CommandWrapper/MCU wrapper classes entirely
    (they're tightly coupled to a full MCUConnectHelper we don't have
    here) and instead replicates what CommandWrapper.send() actually does
    underneath, directly against the bare SerialReader: look up the
    command via msgparser.lookup_command(name), encode it, and hand the
    bytes to serial.raw_send() with serial.get_default_command_queue() —
    both confirmed as real SerialReader methods (not MCU-only) from
    klippy's actual mcu.py source. This is best-effort: a failure to
    find/send the reset command is swallowed, since it should never mask
    the identify data already successfully read.

    Runs as a subprocess under klippy-env's own Python with the connect
    logic passed inline via `-c`, rather than importing klippy's reactor
    directly into this process: klippy's reactor is a full event-loop
    implementation of its own, and running it inside this app's existing
    Textual/asyncio event loop risks real deadlocks, not just a style
    clash. It also depends on a compiled C extension built specifically
    for klippy-env, and its own tooling (e.g. console.py) is
    written/tested against that environment, not this app's own venv.

    Raises EZFException if klippy-env can't be found, the subprocess
    fails, or it doesn't report anything within `timeout` seconds.
