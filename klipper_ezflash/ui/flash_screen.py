Flash flow screen — two-pane layout: steps on the left, live output right.

Replaces `_run_with_progressbox` + the `multiprocessing`(fork) trick
entirely. Command streaming uses `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` and
`async for line in proc.stdout` — this runs on Textual's own asyncio event
loop, no `threading` import and no manual fork/pipe plumbing.

    output into the flash screen's log for the duration of the block.

    Some synchronous library code we call into — notably kconfiglib, via
    Configurator/KConfig — prints warnings directly to stdout/stderr
    during parsing rather than raising or logging through the `logging`
    module. Since that's a direct write to the real terminal, it bypasses
    Textual's rendering entirely and corrupts the screen. This can't be
    streamed live (the call is synchronous, not a subprocess we're
    reading from), but capturing and flushing it into the log after the
    fact at least keeps it inside the app instead of on the raw
    terminal, and it's still visible to the user.

    Separately, Configurator._log_selection() logs every kconfig
    choice/symbol it sets (arch, MCU, interface, etc.) via
    logger.debug() on the 'klipper_ezflash' logger tree — normally
    invisible here, since __main__.py's basicConfig sets the root logger
    to INFO. For the duration of this block only, this attaches a
    handler directly to the 'klipper_ezflash' logger and drops its level
    to DEBUG, so that config-building detail lands in this same

    dialogs.py). On macOS Terminal.app, getting native terminal text
    selection at all inside a Textual app requires holding Fn while
    dragging (Option is iTerm2's equivalent), and even then a
    drag-selection captures every visible character, border glyphs
    included. Keeping this screen down to just Header + the completion
    text (plus a one-line hint) means a Fn-drag selection of the body
    captures exactly the completion message and nothing else — no footer
    keybinding hints, no border-right from a step-list pane, no
    box-drawing dialog border.

    When `config_snippet` is given, it's rendered in its own zero-
    horizontal-padding Static rather than folded into the same padded
    block as the surrounding prose — leaving the intro/outro at their
    original padding would mean every line of the copyable [mcu] section
    starts several blank columns in from the left edge, which a
    drag-select easily includes by accident. That's not just cosmetic:
    printer.cfg's config format treats a leading-whitespace line as a
    continuation of the previous line's value, not a new key, so pasting
    an indented `[mcu]`/`serial:` line can silently break parsing. A
    bordered popup would reintroduce the exact problem the Fn-drag fix
    above solved, so this stays on the same borderless screen — just
    split into separate widgets so the snippet's own box has no left
    padding to accidentally select along with it.

    The intro/outro Statics also carry zero horizontal padding (matching
    the snippet), rather than the screen-wide padding this used to have
    — an indented snippet sitting flush against non-indented prose read
    as a layout bug, not an intentional callout. With everything flush
    left, the snippet's distinct `_CALLOUT` background (a dedicated
    token, more contrasty against `_BG` than `_SURFACE` — see theme.py —
    since `_SURFACE` alone was too close to `_BG` to read as a
    deliberate card rather than a rendering glitch) is what marks it as
    a callout, not indentation. No border on it either, same reasoning
    as above.
